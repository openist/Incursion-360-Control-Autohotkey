Play Incursion the d20/OSRD based the rougelike with a 360 Gamepad!

This is my favorite roguelike and I made this so I could play extended sessions lounging on my couch on the the TV in maximum comfort. An autohotkey scruipt that remaps controls so the game is playable with a xbox controller.  This includes custom modes and even overlays for complicated menu interactions.  This is still a WIP but should be playable.  This script requires autohotkey:

And grab my script from here:

I will compile a binary and upload it once I have done further play testing.  In order for this to work well some specific options need to be set in incursion:

* Clear --more-- Automatically
* Your desktop needs to be 1920x1080
* Incursion should be set to Windowed at 1920x1080
* 16x16 Font Size
* Auto open doors
* Auto kick doors
* Aisable empty handed warning

Here's the Keys:
